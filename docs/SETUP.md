# Environment setup

Target: the same setup on both machines, so code written by one of us runs unchanged for the other.

## 1. WSL2 (Windows only)

KDB-X does not install natively on Windows; it runs under WSL2. On macOS, skip to step 2.

```powershell
wsl --install -d Ubuntu     # admin PowerShell, then reboot
```

**Keep the repo and the data on the WSL filesystem** (`~/code/...`), *not* under `/mnt/c/...` and never in OneDrive. Cross-filesystem I/O is slow, and OneDrive will try to sync gigabytes of tick partitions.

```bash
mkdir -p ~/code && cd ~/code
git clone https://github.com/<owner>/notset-algo-trading-project.git
```

## 2. kdb+/q: KDB-X Community Edition (free)

- Sign up at the KX Developer Center (developer.kx.com). The welcome email contains a base64 `kc.lic` licence key.
- Run the online installer from the Developer Center page. It installs to `~/.kx` and puts `q` on your PATH.
- Terms at the time of writing: free, no expiry, commercial and offline use allowed; limits of about 16 GB RAM per process, 4 secondary threads and 8 IPC connections. Check the current terms on the KX site.
- Each of us uses **our own** licence. Licences never go in the repo.

Check the install:
```bash
q
q)1+1
q)\\
```

## 3. Python

```bash
# Miniforge inside WSL (a separate install from any Windows conda)
curl -L -O https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge/releases/latest/download/Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniforge3-Linux-x86_64.sh
conda create -n notset python=3.12 numpy pandas scipy statsmodels scikit-learn matplotlib pyarrow pyyaml jupyter
conda activate notset
pip install pykx nbstripout
```

PyKX runs q embedded when it can find a licence. Point `QLIC` at the folder holding `kc.lic` (e.g. `export QLIC=~/.kx` in `~/.bashrc`). Once the package list settles, freeze it into `environment.yml` and commit that.

## 4. Java

```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y openjdk-21-jdk maven
java -version && mvn -version
```

The q ↔ Java interface is KX's `javakdb` client (github.com/KxSystems/javakdb), added as a Maven dependency or vendored `c.java` once the `java/` project is created.

## 5. VS Code

Open the repo from WSL (`code .` inside `~/code/notset-algo-trading-project`), then install:
- **WSL** (Microsoft)
- **kdb** (KX): connect to a running q process and run `.q` files or selections
- **Python** + **Jupyter** (Microsoft)
- **Extension Pack for Java** (Microsoft)

## 6. Git identity (inside WSL)

```bash
git config --global user.name  "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "you@fordham.edu"
git config --global core.autocrlf input
sudo apt install -y gh && gh auth login        # simplest way to authenticate pushes
```

## Checklist

- [ ] `q` starts and prints no licence error
- [ ] `python -c "import pykx as kx; print(kx.q('til 3'))"` works
- [ ] `java -version` shows 21, `mvn -version` works
- [ ] repo cloned under `~/code`, not `/mnt/c`
